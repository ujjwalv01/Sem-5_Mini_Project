            Hi, I'm Dr Mitra- physician mom and lean private practice nephrologist.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Why do I work for myself? So I don't have to take anyone's permission for vacation! (I'm only partly kidding).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But running a practice in this day and age of falling reimbursements and rising cost of doing business is HARD. The only way I knew how to pull it off was to run my practice really lean.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I focused on office space because that is the biggest expense for a startup practice. I wanted to sublet a little bit of space from another practice but there was no easy way to do it. I cold called a few practices and got nothing but a string of polite no's.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And that is what planted the seed for Link Medical Spaces: a peer-to-peer platform that directly connects healthcare professionals with medical office space to lease or sublease- think Airbnb or Turo, but for medical offices- so practices can earn passive income or lease only what they need and run leaner, more sustainable practices.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So your practice can support the mission you started it for in the first place.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Because Link Medical Spaces is more than about finding the right office space- it's about empowering private practices to thrive in today's challenging healthcare landscape.
          </p>
